Remarkably, Opportunity and its fellow rover Spirit were initially intended for a 3 month long primary mission. Still exploring, the golf cart-sized robot and shadow (far right) appear in the foreground of this panoramic view of its current location. The mosaic was constructed using images from the rover's navigation camera. On its 7 year anniversary, Opportunity can boast traversing a total of 26.7 kilometers along the martian surface. After investigating Santa Maria crater, controllers plan to have Opportunity resume a long-term trek toward Endeavour crater, a large, 22 kilometer diameter crater about 6 kilometers from Santa Maria. The rim of Endeavour is visible in the mosaic on the horizon at the right, just above the shadow of the rover's mast. During coming days, communication with the rover will be more difficult as Mars moves close to alignment with the Sun as seen from planet Earth's perspective.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1101/OpportunitySol2476_Kremer.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"Opportunity at Santa Maria Crater","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/1101/OpportunitySol2476_Kremer600hc.jpg"},{"copyright":"Nicolas OuttersObservatoire d'Orange","date":"2006-08-16","explanation":"Here are some familiar shapes in unfamiliar locations.  This emission nebula on the left is famous partly because it resembles Earth's continent of North America.  To the right of the North America Nebula, cataloged as NGC 7000, is a less luminous nebula that resembles a pelican dubbed the Pelican Nebula.  The two emission nebula measure about 50 light-years across, are located about 1500 light-years away, and are separated by a dark absorption cloud.  This spectacular image captures, in false color, the nebulas, bright ionization fronts, and fine details of the dark dust. The nebulae can be seen with binoculars from a dark location.  Look for a small nebular patch north-east of bright star Deneb in the constellation of Cygnus.  It is still unknown which star or stars ionize the red-glowing hydrogen gas.","hdurl":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/northamerica_outters_big.jpg","media_type":"image","service_version":"v1","title":"The North America and Pelican Nebulas","url":"https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0608/northamerica_outters.jpg"},{"copyright":"Ruslan MerzlyakovRMS Photography","date":"2018-12-16","explanation":"Today Comet Wirtanen passes by the Earth. The kilometer-sized dirty snowball orbits the Sun every 5.4 years, ranging as far out as Jupiter and as close in as the Earth. Today Comet 46P/Wirtanen passes within only 31 lunar distances to the Earth, the closest approach in 70 years.  If you know where to look (Taurus), you can see the comet through binoculars as an unusual blue smudge.  Pictured a week ago, Comet Wirtanen was photographed in the sky beyond an old abandoned church in Skagen, Denmark.  The image composite also captures the astrophotographer.  After today, the comet will begin to fade as it recedes from the Earth and the Sun.
